## Building New Data Source Adapters

Cascade Cards is designed to be extensible through data source adapters. To create a new adapter:

1. Implement the `DataSource` interface from `cascade-cards-core`
2. Add the adapter to `packages/sources/your-adapter`
3. Include tests and documentation
4. Export a factory function for easy usage

See the existing [markdown](packages/sources/markdown) and [rest](packages/sources/rest) adapters for reference.

## Testing

- Unit tests with Vitest
- Component tests with React Testing Library

Run tests:
```bash
pnpm test          # Run all tests
pnpm test:watch    # Watch mode
pnpm test:coverage # With coverage
```

## Type Checking

```bash
pnpm typecheck     # Type check all packages
```

## Building

```bash
pnpm build         # Build all packages
pnpm clean         # Clean all build outputs
```

## Documentation
- Update README files for any new features
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep the main README.md up to date with new features

## Publishing

Packages are published to npm by maintainers. To publish:

```bash
# Make sure you're logged in to npm
npm login

# From each package directory
cd packages/core
pnpm run prepublishOnly
npm publish

cd ../react
pnpm run prepublishOnly
npm publish

# etc...
```
